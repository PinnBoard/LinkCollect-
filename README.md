# LinkCollect Backend

This repository contains the setup for the LinkCollect backend using TypeScript and Docker for development. Utilizing Docker makes the development process more straightforward. You can create a Docker image and test the database and backend effortlessly by running the commands provided in the makefile. The setup will generate a "mongo" folder in your repository. After signing up, you can test your endpoints.

For development purposes, creating an Nginx image is optional. The Nginx image acts as a proxy to our backend port, facilitating smoother interactions.
